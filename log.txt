We have already got our project idea and also chose the right local llm for this task which is Llama-2-7B-instruct
so now of to finding the right dataset we can use to finetune this model
    apprently llama-2-7B-instruct does not exist in ollama library so we proceed with a similar model llama3.1:8B which has 
    similar capability. 

we tested llama3.1 with a couple of examples to respond to email and write a draft and it turned out be like this: 
            >>> Write a short professional reply to this email:
            ... 
            ... "Hi Kumneger, can you send me the latest project report by today?"
            ... 
            Here is a short professional reply:

            "Hi [Name],

            I've checked on the status of the project report. Unfortunately, I don't have an update on its completion yet. I'll follow up with the team lead to confirm when it will be available.

            Best regards,
            Kumneger"

            >>> Summarize this email thread and suggest a reply:
            ... 
            ... Email 1: "Hi Kumneger, can you update me on the Q2 metrics?"
            ... Email 2: "Also, we need to finalize the presentation for Friday."
            ... Email 3: "Let me know if you need help compiling data."
            ... 
            **Summary:**

            The email thread consists of three messages requesting updates from Kumneger:

            1. An initial request for an update on Q2 metrics.
            2. A subsequent request to finalize a presentation for Friday.
            3. An offer of assistance in compiling data for the presentation.

            **Reply Suggestion:**

            Since Kumneger hasn't responded yet, I'd suggest sending a brief reply to acknowledge their requests and ask for an update on the status of both tasks:

            "Hi [Name],

            Thanks for reaching out about the Q2 metrics and presentation. I'm still working on gathering the necessary data, but I'll prioritize these tasks to meet the deadline.

            I may take you up on your offer of help with compiling data - I'll let you know if I need assistance.

            Best regards,
            Kumneger"

            >>> Draft a reply and schedule a meeting at 3 PM tomorrow:
            ... 
            ... "Hi Kumneger, are you free to discuss the new client proposal tomorrow afternoon?"
            ... 
            Here's a draft reply:

            "Hi [Name],

            Yes, I'm available to discuss the new client proposal. How about we schedule a meeting for 3:00 PM tomorrow? Would that work for you?

            Looking forward to discussing it with you then.

            Best regards,
            Kumneger"

            Alternatively, if you'd like to make it more concise:

            "Hi [Name],

            I'm free to meet tomorrow at 3:00 PM. Shall we discuss the new client proposal then?

            Best regards,
            Kumneger"
            
and i believe this means we can proceed with it
